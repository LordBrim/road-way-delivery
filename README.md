## My Goal With This Project

My goal was to simulate a professional work environment.

- I built this app using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for the styling.
- I used Figma to design this app to practice creating components and planning out the layout of a landing page.

### Features

- Static pages
- Multipage routing
- Fast loading
- Viewport Responsive

## If I Had More Time I Would Change These

- <strike>I would redesign the landing page to have a more rounded modern look.</strike>
- Add mockups where they can be placed.
- Create a UI Kit specifically for this project.
- Use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to streamline the development process of the components.

## I Had More Time

- I redesigned the landing page to have a more rounded modern look.
