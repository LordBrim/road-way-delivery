## What Is Roadway Delivery?

Roadway Delivery is mock landing page for a delivery service, a leading logistics company transforming the transportation industry with fast, secure, and reliable road delivery solutions.

## My Goal With This Project

My goal was to simulate a professional work environment.

- I built this landing page using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for the styling.
- I used Figma to design this landing page to practice creating components and planning out the layout of a landing page.
- To build a responsive and fluid website.
- To optimize the page using Lighthouse.

## If I Had More Time I Would Change These

- <strike>I would redesign the landing page to have a more rounded modern look.</strike>
- Add mockups where they can be placed.
- Add animations to content
- Attain a Lighthouse score of 100 for every criteria
- Make this landing page into an actual delivery application.
- Apply SEO principles to increase search visibility
- Readd routing to other pages

## I Had More Time

- I redesigned the landing page to have a more rounded modern look.
